# License-Plate
This project enhances license plate detection in low-light conditions using deep learning. By integrating MIRNet, YOLOv10, and GANs for image enhancement, it improves visibility and feature extraction. A hybrid detection model ensures real-time accuracy. Trained on diverse datasets, it supports applications in toll collection, law enforcement, and smart city surveillance.
